### Hi, I'm Jack

I go to school at WashU (the one in St. Louis). I spent the summer of 2022 as an intern at Microsoft working on [Azure for Operators Distributed Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-azure-for-operators-solutions-and-services-built-for-the-future-of-telecommunications/).

> I'm currently working on [Hack WashU](https://hackwashu.io), a hybrid event taking place from Oct. 14 to Oct. 16!

I have experience in:
- Full-stack web development
- Cloud computing
- Quantum computing
- DevOps and System Design

Feel free to reach out to me at (firstname)(lastname)5 at gmail dot com.
