### Hi, I'm Jack 

I go to school at WashU (the one in St. Louis üêª). I'll be spending Summer 2023 as a SWE intern on a team within Gaming Player Experiences at Microsoft. I was at MSFT for Summer '22 working on [Azure Operator Nexus](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-for-operators-blog/introducing-azure-operator-nexus/ba-p/3753393). This year I'll be working on [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/cloud-gaming)

I have experience in:
- Full-stack web development
- Cloud computing
- DevOps and system design
- Linux system administration

Feel free to reach out to me -- (lastname) at duck dot com.
