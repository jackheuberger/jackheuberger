### Hi, I'm Jack

I go to school at WashU (the one in St. Louis). I'll be spending Summer 2023 as a SWE intern on a team within Gaming Player Experiences at Microsoft. I spent the summer of 2022 as an intern at Microsoft working on [Azure for Operators Distributed Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-azure-for-operators-solutions-and-services-built-for-the-future-of-telecommunications/). 

I have experience in:
- Full-stack web development
- Cloud computing
